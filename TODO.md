# TODO LIST

## Exit cycle

## Validations
* validations() func to call gameplay() function and then free everything after its return
* validate_chars() to only swap spaces into 1's from inside the string
* wall_check() logic evaluation. Can it be shorter?
* Clarify function and variable naming

## Main
* Move gameplay() away || move txtr structs init to main, enabling easy mem management after gameplay()
